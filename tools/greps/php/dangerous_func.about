These functions are dangerous and should be avoided whenever possible.
If you *must* use them, make sure that all the parameters have been
correctly filtered and validated to prevent vulnerabilities. Note that
the backtick operator should always be avoided and the shell_exec function
be used in its place for better lisibility.
