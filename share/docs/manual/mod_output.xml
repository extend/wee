	<title>Output module</title>
	<para>
		The output module is a module that you will probably always require but that won't have much need to interact with.
		It currently does two things worth noting: it <ulink url="http://php.net/outcontrol">controls the output buffering</ulink>
		and can encode or decode variables according to the current output driver.
	</para>
	<para>
		There is a few different output drivers available.
		The default driver is <literal>weeXHTMLOutput</literal> and define encoding methods for XHTML content.
		There is also a <literal>weeTextOutput</literal> driver that you can use for outputting plain text,
		for example when writing emails or sending a text report.
		Finally there is <literal>weeLaTeXOutput</literal> and <literal>weePDFOutput</literal>
		that are used to output PDF files.
	</para>
	<para>
		The application module uses the option <literal>output.driver</literal> to define the default driver used.
	</para>
	<para>
		The main attraction of the output drivers is the automatic encoding of variables
		when you send them to your <link linkend="mod_output_tpl">templates</link>.
		Each output driver define its own encoding (and decoding) rules, so you only have to worry about using the correct output.
	</para>

		<title>Switching output</title>
		<para>
			Most of the time you will only use what you defined as the default output driver through the <literal>output.driver</literal> configuration option.
			There are times however when you need to change the driver, either temporarily, or for the duration of the request.
		</para>
		<para>
			You can change the output driver used simply by selecting it.
			When no output driver has been created, you only need to instantiate one to use it.
			In other cases, you must call the static method <literal>weeOutput::select</literal>.
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-select.php.xml"/>
		</para>
		<para>
			If you need to change the output only temporarily,
			you can use the return value of the static method <literal>weeOutput::select</literal>.
			It indeed returns the previous output object.
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-select-tmp.php.xml"/>

	<sect1 id="mod_output_control">
		<title>Output control</title>
		<para>
			The output drivers provide a <literal>bufferize</literal> method that will
			start the output buffering and try to enabled GZIP compression if it is available.
			If you use the application module then output will be started automatically
			according to the driver you setup in the configuration file.
			Otherwise you can start output by simply creating the output driver you want.
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-new.php.xml"/>
		</para>
		<para>
			You can choose to buffer output by calling bufferize.
			By default, it will compress the output to GZIP if possible.
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-bufferize.php.xml"/>
		</para>
		<para>
			You can also choose to not use GZIP compression by giving false as the first parameter.
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-bufferize-no-gzip.php.xml"/>
		</para>
		<para>
			Or you can control the bufferization and the compression directly when creating the object.
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-options.php.xml"/>
		</para>
		<para>
			When using the application module, you can control these two options directly from the configuration file.

	<sect1 id="mod_output_tpl">
		<title>Templates</title>
		<para>
			A template is a master document used to <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separate content from presentation</ulink>.
			It is often used for mass-production of documents.
			There is different kinds of templates depending on the type of document it defines.
			Type of templates include <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template">web templates</ulink>,
			<link linkend="mod_mail_send_tpl">email templates</link>
			and <link linkend="mod_output_pdf">LaTeX templates</link> (used to generate PDF files, for example).
		</para>
		<para>
			A template effectively represents the view in the <link linkend="mod_app_mvc">MVC Architecture</link>.
			The frame, a component of the controller tier, is responsible for <link linkend="mod_app_events_tpl">defining the view</link>
			used to build the reply to the request it received.
			It is also responsible for sending data taken from the <link linkend="mod_model">model</link> to the view.
		</para>
		<para>
			This means the view is only responsible for outputting everything.
			As opposed to other implementations of the <literal>MVC</literal> design pattern,
			the view does not have to retrieve data, the view actually expects that all data it requires has been provided to it.
			Missing data will produce an <link linkend="core_exceptions_default">error page</link>.
		</para>

		<sect2>
			<title>Usage</title>
			<para>
				If you are using the application module, <link linkend="mod_app_events_tpl">please refer to this chapter</link>.
			</para>
			<para>
				If you are not using the application framework, you can create a template simply by creating an instance.
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-tpl-new.php.xml"/>
			</para>
			<para>
				This will load the file <filename>app/tpl/myexample.tpl</filename>.
			</para>
			<para>
				You can change the default template path (<filename>app/tpl</filename>) by defining the <literal>TPL_PATH</literal> constant.
				Similarly, you can change the template extension (<literal>.tpl</literal>) by defining the <literal>TPL_EXT</literal> constant in your bootstrap file.
			</para>
			<para>
				Sending data to the template is really simple.
				It works exactly the same whether you use the application module or not.
				You just need to call the <literal>set</literal> method.
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-tpl-set.php.xml"/>
			</para>
			<para>
				Same example with the application module.
				The <literal>set</literal> method of <literal>weeFrame</literal> simply redirects the data to the template.
				The frame will not create the template until required.
				This means that the first call to <literal>set</literal> will effectively create the template object.
				If you don't use <literal>set</literal> the template will be created before it must be rendered.
				In some cases, for example when sending a <link linkend="mod_app_taconite">taconite reply</link> in an xmlhttprequest context,
				the template might not be created at all, saving resources.
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-tpl-set-app.php.xml"/>
			</para>
			<para>
				You may prefer to use an alternative syntax for the <literal>set</literal> method,
				allowing to pass more variables in the same call.
				Simply give an array as a single parameter instead of two.
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-tpl-set-app-array.php.xml"/>
			</para>
			<para>
				There is no need to encode the data passed to the template using the <literal>set</literal> method.
				All data is encoded automatically according to the output driver you selected.
				You must however encode data if it is not processed by the <literal>set</literal> method.
				You must also encode data passed using the <literal>set</literal> method as an object that doesn't extend the <ulink url="http://extend.ws/api/HEAD/#weeDataSource">weeDataSource class</ulink>.
				The best way to write secure template is to write them completely standalone, requiring only input from the <literal>set</literal> method.
			</para>
			<para>
				These three examples result in exactly the same data passed to the template.
				On the template's side, this effectively creates variables using the names and values your provided.
				You can then output them as needed.
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-tpl-example.html.xml"/>
			</para>
			<para>
				You should use the <ulink url="http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.alternative-syntax.php">alternative syntax for control structures</ulink> in your templates.
				It is the easier syntax to read, as was demonstrated here.
			</para>
			<para>
				Note that PHP has a tendency to remove the line break immediately following <literal>?&gt;</literal>, resulting in a badly formatted file.
				Although white spaces do not really matter when dealing with XHTML, it becomes a problem if you're outputting other formats like plain text.
				This problem can be resolved by appending a space after <literal>?&gt;</literal>.
				It is good practice to always put a space after all the <literal>?&gt;</literal> that are followed by a line break.
			</para>
			<para>
				A template can include another template.
				A common use of this functionality is to separate
				the header and the footer of the page into their own templates.
				Here is an example such template file:
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-tpl-nested.html.xml"/>
			</para>
			<para>
				We can do this because we are actually executing code in the <literal>weeTemplate</literal> class.
				You could call any of its methods if you wanted to.
				Note however that it is neither safe nor a good practice to call a method
				other than <literal>template</literal> and <literal>mkLink</literal> (detailed below).
			</para>
			<para>
				The nested template will receive all the data that has been submitted to the main template.
				You can also send additional data by specifying it in an array given as a second parameter to the <literal>template</literal> method.
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2>
			<title>Safe link generation</title>
			<para>
				<literal>weeTemplate</literal> contain methods that can be used to build links.
				The links can be pre-parameterized, allowing you to specify in advance a number
				of variables that will be appended to all the links built using the template's method.
			</para>
			<para>
				To add parameters to the links, simply call <literal>addLinkArgs</literal>:
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-tpl-addlinkargs.php.xml"/>
			</para>
			<para>
				Then, if you call <literal>mkLink</literal> from within the template, a correct link containing these two parameters will be built.
				Make sure the link you give is not HTML encoded; in other words you need to <literal>decode</literal> it if you passed it to the template from within the frame.
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-tpl-addlinkargs.html.xml"/>
			</para>
			<para>
				You can pass additional parameters to the method that will be appended only for this link.
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-tpl-addlinkargs2.html.xml"/>
			</para>
			<para>
				As you can see, this can save you a lot of typing if all your links must contain the same parameters.
			</para>
			<para>
				Note that there is currently no proxy method in <literal>weeFrame</literal> to add parameters to links using <literal>addLinkArgs</literal>.
				Unfortunately, this means you'll have to write a few more lines to ensure it works as intended. This will be fixed before going stable.
			</para>
			<para>
				You have to ensure the template is created before calling the method.
				This can be achieved by using the following code:
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-tpl-addlinkargs-app.php.xml"/>
			</para>
			<para>
				Using this event in a frame will send the correct link parameters to the template,
				making all links created with <literal>mkLink</literal> contain a <emphasis>location</emphasis> and <emphasis>year</emphasis> parameter.
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2>
			<title>Rendering</title>
			<para>
				If you are using the application module you do not need to render templates yourself.
				In other cases, a template can be easily rendered by using the method <literal>render</literal>.
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-tpl-render.php.xml"/>
			</para>
			<para>
				You can also retrieve the output of a template by calling the method <literal>toString</literal>.
				You can then process it as you wish.
				The following example will replace all <emphasis>example</emphasis>
				by <emphasis>demo</emphasis> in the resulting string and then output it.
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-tpl-tostring.php.xml"/>

		<title>PDF output</title>
		<para>
			This chapter will describe how you can use the output module to output PDF files built using <ulink url="http://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX</ulink>.
			It will describe how to setup the framework for this type of output and attempt to provide a tutorial for the most common tasks along with various hints and advices.

			<title>Why LaTeX?</title>
			<para>
				It makes a lot of sense to use LaTeX instead of some PHP library, if you can.
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><para>You can use templates.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>You can separate your documents into different templates.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>You can design your document using any editor you wish.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>The technology is proven and is widely used.</para></listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</para>
			<para>
				However it might not be available on all hosts.
				If you administer the server then there's no worry, you can always install it,
				but on shared environments you might have to fall back to a PHP library.
				Make sure you know the specifications of the destination host of your application before starting developments.
			</para>

		<sect2>
			<title>Usage</title>
			<para>
				First, make sure that you have LaTeX installed.
				There is various LaTeX distributions that you can use,
				we suggest you use the one recommended for your operating system.
				Make sure you have an executable called <literal>pdflatex</literal> after installation.
				You might also want to install all additional LaTeX packages
				since they contain more environments that you might want to use in your project.
			</para>
			<para>
				The first thing you need to make sure of is that the binary for <literal>pdflatex</literal> is available in your <literal>PATH</literal>.
				If it isn't, you can add it by putting the following line of code in your bootstrap file:
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-pdf-path.php.xml"/>
			</para>
			<para>
				Then all you need to do is select the PDF Output whenever you need it.
				The following code will select it and add a few options.
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/build/output-pdf-usage.php.xml"/>
			</para>
			<para>
				From this point onward, templates will automatically encode data to LaTeX as needed.
				So you have no need to worry about special characters when you send data to the template.
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2>
			<title>LaTeX resources</title>
			<para>
				There is <ulink url="http://www.latex-project.org/guides/">a lot of resources</ulink> available to learn LaTeX.
				There exists also quite a few user-friendly editors that can help you design LaTeX document.
				If you need one, we recommend <ulink url="http://kile.sourceforge.net">Kile</ulink>.
