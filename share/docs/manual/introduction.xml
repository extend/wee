	<title>Introduction</title>
	<para>
		Web:Extend is an open source PHP5 framework focused on ease of use and efficiency. It is licensed under the LGPL.
		The main contributor of the project is the company <ulink url="http://dev-extend.eu">Dev:Extend</ulink>.
	</para>

	<sect1 id="introduction_philosophy">
		<title>Philosophy</title>
		<para>
			The development team tries to adhere to the following philosophy whenever possible.
		</para>

		<sect2>
			<title>Simplicity</title>
			<para>
				<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicity">Simplicity</ulink> is the property,
				condition, or quality of being straightforward or uncomplicated. In some circumstances it 
				denotes beauty,	purity or clarity. Simple things are usually easier to explain and understand 
				than complicated ones, and can indicate freedom from hardship, effort or confusion.
			</para>
			<para>
				In context, a developer using Web:Extend should be able to translate any project
				requirements into a finished application with minimal planning and implementation.
				Ideally, the developer should not have to focus on anything other than the requirements themselves.
				The tools available should be easy to use and understand, and should also present as few 
				disruptions as possible in the implemtation of any task.
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2>
			<title>Small and efficient framework</title>
			<sect3>
				<title>Passive view MVC</title>
				<para>
					The framework gives you the possibility to use a variant of the MVC pattern.
					This variant is explained in details by <ulink url="http://martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</ulink>
					in his <ulink url="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html">passive view article</ulink>.
					It is designed to enhance testability, but it also gives a much simpler approach to MVC.
					The passive view receives data from the controller and renders the page. That's it.
					The passive view do not need to access the model or the controller. <link linkend="mod_app_mvc">Read more about the MVC architecture...</link>
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3>
				<title>Minimal interface</title>
				<para>
					The framework is designed as a <ulink url="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MinimalInterface.html">Minimal Interface</ulink>.
					This means classes will only have methods that are strictly needed for its purpose.
					This allows you to learn it much more easily because classes are small and go to the point.
					We sometimes also add convenience methods when there's a noticeable pattern in the class use.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3>
				<title>Write less but better code</title>
				<para>
					By keeping things simple, the framework helps you write better code.
					We think the developer should be able to create an application with very few lines of code.
					You should not have to handle technicalities, the framework can do it for you.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3>
				<title>Automating security where possible</title>
				<para>
					We think the developer shouldn't have to worry about security.
					It's the job of the framework to make sure the application is secure.
					This can be enforced by adding various checks and security measures
					inside the framework, along with a set of recommendations.
					We also provide information about the various security issues that can arise directly in the documentation.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3>
				<title>Loose coupling</title>
				<para>
					Each module of the framework is loosely coupled.
					This means you can choose to use any module you want.
					If you don't want to use the MVC architecture, you don't have to.
					You can directly access the database instead of using models,
					or you can write a script using only the database and mail modules to send emails to all your users.
					You are free to use the code the way you want to, without any restriction.
					And if you find out you can't do that for some reason, you should consider reporting it as a bug.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3>
				<title>No bloat</title>
				<para>
					Bloat is not exactly the opposite of simplicity, but it's certainly
					one of the causes leading to complexity in a lot of softwares.
					We think bloat is bad. Bloat can happen for various reasons:
						following trends to look cool,
						focusing on adding features for only a small subset of users,
						generating code automatically,
						adding features already available by other means,
						etc.
					That's something we can promise to never do.
					You might think generating code is a good thing,
					well maybe it is, but we think we have a better solution.
					And for everything else, there will be plugins.

			<title>Developers, developers, developers</title>
			<para>
				We think the developers (the users of our product) are the most important people in the world.
				Therefore we always listen carefully to their inputs and provide help whenever possible.
				You can find help by contacting us directly, through a mailing list, IRC,
				but also by opening tickets asking for more documentation or tutorials.
			</para>
			<para>
				We also need your help.
				Please forward us comments or suggestions so we can improve the product.
				We are listening.

		<title>Goals</title>
		<para>
			Web:Extend was officially created in 2006.
			Work began in 2005 on various modules that would lead to the creation of the framework.
			The goal at the time was to make a form generator to simplify form handling and validation.
			This form generator was rewritten 3 times up to this day,
			leading to the current implementation that uses XSL stylesheets to transform an XML into HTML,
			along with <ulink url="http://php.net/simplexml">SimpleXML</ulink> for manipulation and validation.
		</para>
		<para>
			Web:Extend was created because no framework used all the power of PHP5 at the time.
			We believe it's still true today. Most of the power of PHP5 comes from the
			<ulink url="http://php.net/spl">SPL</ulink> and from the SimpleXML extensions.
			Interfaces like <ulink url="http://php.net/iterator">Iterator</ulink> or
			<ulink url="http://php.net/arrayaccess">ArrayAccess</ulink> simplify everything.
			That's why we use them everywhere it makes sense to.
		</para>
		<para>
			The current goals are:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>To provide a simple, consistent but also powerful API for common operations</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>To reduce the development times using the framework</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>To build a high-performance application framework</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>To allow extensibility through a simple-to-use plugin system</para></listitem>
