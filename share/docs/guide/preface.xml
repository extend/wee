	<title>Purpose of this guide</title>

	<para>This guide describes the installation and usage of the
	Web:Extend PHP framework. It is an introductory guide rather
	than a complete reference, addressed primarily to new Web:Extend
	developers.</para>

	<para>This guide is not a PHP tutorial: knowledge of the PHP5
	language is required. Although we provide an explanatory chapter,
	it is also recommended to understand the concepts of relational
	databases and their use in web applications.</para>

	<para>You are welcome to contribute to this guide through
	additions, corrections or translations. See <xref linkend="ap-contrib"/>
