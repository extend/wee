	<title>Addons management</title>

	<para>Addons are currently an <emphasis>experimental feature</emphasis> of
	the Web:Extend framework. An appropriate guide will be written when the
	feature becomes stable. Until then you can take a look inside the
	<filename>addons.php</filename> file to learn how it works, or just run it
	without parameters:</para>

<screen>
$ <userinput>php addons.php</userinput>
Usage: addons.php [options] [addon]
...</screen>

	<para>We don't recommend using the addons management system yet. It will
	however become an important feature of the framework in the following
	releases.</para>
