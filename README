Web:Extend, aka 'wee', is a PHP5 framework designed to allow developers
to write less, but better code easily. It is not a huge, bloated framework,
it does not generate code, it just lets you write understandable code
in a few lines.

Web:Extend is currently alpha software. It is used by a few people in
production environments but you should be aware that it has not been
tested enough to be considered stable or even beta. Please help us by
testing it and developing with it.

You can find documentation on http://wee.extend.ws on the Trac wiki,
along with the SVN web interface and the bug reporting system. If you
find a bug please report it there and NOT on sourceforge.

If the documentation you're looking for has not yet been written, or
if you wish to discuss about Web:Extend, please post to our mailing
list at http://groups.google.com/group/wee-users

Finally, please be aware that the current testing tools included will
be rewritten shortly. They are currently not adequate and you should
avoid using them. If you need a good testing tool you can look at
PHPUnit for example.

Thank you for trying this software.
