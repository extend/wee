Web:Extend, aka 'wee', is a PHP5 framework designed to allow developers
to write less, but better code easily. It is not a huge, bloated framework,
it does not generate code, it just lets you write understandable code
in a few lines.

Web:Extend is currently beta software. It is used by a few people in
production environments but you should be aware that it has not been
tested enough to be considered stable. Please help us by testing it
and submitting bug reports.

You can find documentation on http://wee.extend.ws/wiki/Documentation
along with the SVN web interface and the bug reporting system. If you
find a bug please report it there and NOT on sourceforge.

If you wish to discuss about Web:Extend, please post to our mailing
list at http://groups.google.com/group/wee-users

Thank you for trying this software.
